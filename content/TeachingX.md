# Teaching and Learning

### Graduate-Level Teaching
The graduate course which most closely aligns with my research is **GS/CSE 6330 3.0 "Technoableism"** (prior title:“Critical Technical Practise: Computer Accessibility and Assistive Technology”). This course examines issues at the intersection of ableism and  technological design in computer accessibility and computational forms of assistive technology (hardware and/or software). Students learn to critically reflect on the hidden assumptions, ideologies and values underlying the design of these technologies, and to analyse and to design them.

I also teach the graduate course **GS/EECS 5351 3.0 “Human-Computer Interaction”**.

My teaching practice also includes **supervisory relationships** with students in several different graduate programs.  I serve as mentor and advisor to students as they complete the requirements of their graduate programs, which typically includes coursework and a scholarly work, such as a Dissertation, Thesis, or Major Research Project (MRP).  Typically, these graduate students become members of the [Practices in Enabling Technologies (PiET) Lab](https://piet.apps01.yorku.ca/) and they undertake their scholarly works using the infrastructure of the lab, alongside other lab projects and initiatives.
### Undergraduate Courses

**EECS 4080 3.0 “Computer Science Project”**, **EECS 4088 6.0 “Computer Science Capstone Project”**: These are upper-year project based courses. I have supervised a number of project courses on an individual basis.  Student who seek to complete either  of these project courses under my supervision are invited to send project proposals to me via email.  Please consult the [Supplemental Calendar for EECS Courses](http://eecs.lassonde.yorku.ca/current-students/undergrads-courses/) further information.

**EECS 3461 3.0 “User Interfaces”**  
**EECS 4441 3.0 “Human Computer Interaction”**   
**EECS 4461 3.0 “Interactive Media Technologies”** 

I also teach some of the first-year courses that are core to the Computer Science and the Digital Media degree programs.
