# My Brief Personal History
Before beginning my faculty appointment at York University in 2004, I completed MSc and PhD degrees at the University of Toronto in the Department of Computer Science under the supervision of Prof Graeme Hirst.  My dissertation was jointly supervised by Prof Fraser Shein.  Before coming to Toronto, I completed a Joint Honours BMath at the University of Waterloo, combining Combinatorics and Optimization with Computer Science.  I started in a different undergraduate degree program, a dual degree between BMath and the Honours BA program in Visual Arts, but did not continue that course of studies. I am a first generation Canadian whose parents immigrated to Ontario at the tail end of the big immigration wave of the 1950-60’s, and I grew up in London, Ontario.
